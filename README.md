LLM Engineering Portfolio
This repository contains a collection of projects and assignments from a comprehensive, hands-on course in Generative AI and LLM Engineering. The projects demonstrate a strong foundation in building, fine-tuning, and deploying cutting-edge AI applications for real-world scenarios.

What You'll Find Here
Throughout this course, I have worked with a diverse set of tools, models, and techniques to build advanced AI products from the ground up. This repository serves as a portfolio of my work, covering everything from initial experimentation to full-scale production deployment.

Key Concepts & Technologies Mastered

Advanced AI Products: Developed complex Generative AI applications using modern frameworks.

Model Experimentation: Gained proficiency with over 20 groundbreaking AI models, including both Frontier (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) and Open-Source models (e.g., from HuggingFace).

Key Platforms & Libraries: Became proficient with platforms like HuggingFace, LangChain, and Gradio.

State-of-the-Art Techniques: Implemented advanced techniques such as RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), QLoRA fine-tuning, and autonomous Agents.

Course Projects
This repository includes a series of hands-on projects, each designed to tackle a specific business challenge.

Project 1: AI-Powered Brochure Generator: A business Gen AI product that intelligently scrapes company websites and creates formatted sales brochures.

Project 2: Multi-modal Customer Support Agent: A comprehensive customer support agent for an airline that interacts with text, sound, and images. The project includes a UI and function-calling capabilities.

Project 3: Automated Meeting Minutes: A tool that transcribes meeting audio and generates concise meeting minutes and action items using both open- and closed-source models.

Project 4: AI Code Optimizer: An AI tool that converts Python code to optimized C++, achieving a performance improvement of over 60,000x.

Project 5: AI Knowledge-Worker: An application using RAG to become an expert on all company-related matters by retrieving information from a shared drive.

Project 6 & 7: Price Prediction Capstone: A two-part capstone project focused on e-commerce price prediction. I developed a model using Frontier APIs and then fine-tuned an open-source model to compete with its performance.

Project 8: Autonomous Agent System: The final capstone project: an autonomous agent system that collaborates with models to spot deals and notify users of special bargains.

Repository Structure
The repository is organized by week, mirroring the course's progression. Each weekly folder contains the code and notebooks for the projects and exercises covered.

week1/: Foundations and first projects.

week2/: Frontier APIs and customer service chatbots.

week3/: Open-source models and meeting minute generator.

week4/: LLM selection and code generation.

week5/: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) implementation.

week6/: Transition from inference to training and fine-tuning Frontier models.

week7/: Advanced training techniques like QLoRA fine-tuning on open-source models.

week8/: Deployment to production and finalization of agent systems.
