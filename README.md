# LLM Engineering Portfolio

This repository is a collection of projects and assignments from a comprehensive, hands-on course in **Generative AI and LLM Engineering**. It demonstrates a strong foundation in building, fine-tuning, and deploying cutting-edge AI applications for real-world scenarios.

## What You'll Find Here

Throughout this course, I have worked with a diverse set of tools, models, and techniques to build advanced AI products from the ground up. This repository serves as a portfolio of my work, covering everything from initial experimentation to full-scale production deployment.

---

## Key Concepts & Technologies Mastered

- **Advanced AI Products:** Developed complex Generative AI applications using modern frameworks.  
- **Model Experimentation:** Gained proficiency with over 20 AI models, including Frontier models (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) and Open-Source models (e.g., HuggingFace).  
- **Key Platforms & Libraries:** Experienced with HuggingFace, LangChain, and Gradio.  
- **State-of-the-Art Techniques:** Implemented advanced methods such as RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), QLoRA fine-tuning, and autonomous agents.

## Course Projects

This repository includes a series of hands-on projects, each addressing a specific business challenge:

1. **AI-Powered Brochure Generator**  
   Scrapes company websites and creates formatted sales brochures automatically.  

2. **Multi-modal Customer Support Agent**  
   A comprehensive customer support agent for an airline that interacts with **text, sound, and images**, including a UI and function-calling capabilities.  

3. **Automated Meeting Minutes**  
   Transcribes meeting audio and generates concise minutes and action items using both open- and closed-source models.  

4. **AI Code Optimizer**  
   Converts Python code to optimized C++, achieving **performance improvements over 60,000x**.  

5. **AI Knowledge-Worker**  
   Uses RAG to become an expert on all company-related matters by retrieving information from a shared drive.  

6. **Price Prediction Capstone (Part 1)**  
   Developed an e-commerce price prediction model using Frontier APIs.  

7. **Price Prediction Capstone (Part 2)**  
   Fine-tuned an open-source model to compete with Frontier API performance.  

8. **Autonomous Agent System**  
   Final capstone: an autonomous agent system that collaborates with models to spot deals and notify users of special bargains.
