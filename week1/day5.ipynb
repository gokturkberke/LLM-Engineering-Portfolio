      "What if we reverted the metric for a change, and look at the impact you can have by *removing* lines of code? Believe me, as soon as your project is big enough, it can be a much better descriptor of one's impact. Keeping the codebase sane and clean by removing the dirt that accumulates over the years is deeply underrated, and one of the maintainers biggest challenges.\n",
      "Just look at the diffs of the PR I'm sharing: this is the kind of things that really got the whole Transformers team excited, not the other way around 🙃\n",

      "Now, for you daily dose of free-lunch optimizations (I keep telling you, we're very good cooks... 🥘):\n",
      "Starting from v4.56 (latest release), we now always restrict the K-V cache size up to the sliding window, both for full sliding models, and for hybrid models. For full sliding window models such as Mistral, this means the Cache simply stops growing after enough tokens are seen, so the memory footprint of decoding is only dictated by the sliding window, and you will never OOM your gpu anymore (see 2nd image). For hybrid models, such as Gpt-OSS, only the full layers will contribute to the cache growth after the sliding window is reached, thus effectively reducing memory usage by the layer pattern. For example, for Gpt-OSS, 1 out of 2 layers is sliding, so the memory usage is reduced by a factor 2x (see 3rd image).\n",
      "But it's not all. As we are passing fewer states to the attention computation primitives, you will also experience significant inference speedups as you start generating beyond the sliding window, as before all tokens would be passed, but most would be masked. The longer your sequence, the more speedups you will experience.\n",
      "And once again, this is all done behind the scenes by default, so simply enjoy! 🤗\n",
